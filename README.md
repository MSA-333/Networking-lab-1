🌐 Cisco Packet Tracer Lab – Static IP with Dynamic Routing (Cyber Sentinel Program)
This networking lab was created using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of the Cyber Sentinel online program by Tech Hierarchy. It demonstrates a basic network setup using static IP addressing and dynamic routing.

🔧 Network Topology Overview

🖥 4 PCs (2 connected to each switch)

🔀 2 Switches

🌐 1 Router

🔌 Copper straight-through cables for all connections

🧠 Static IP addresses

🔄 Dynamic routing configured on the router


🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

Assigning static IP addresses to end devices

Understanding and configuring dynamic routing on a router

Properly connecting network devices using appropriate cables

Verifying device communication using Packet Tracer simulation mode

Exploring how routers forward data across different networks
